            <h1>The mysterious Indus Valley Civilisation</h1>
            <h2>Ancient South Asia's Forgotten Empire</h2>
            <p>
                One of the world's oldest and most enigmatic civilisations
                flourished along the banks of the Indus River around 3300 BCE.
                Stretching across what is now Pakistan, northwest India, and
                parts of Afghanistan, the Indus Valley Civilisation — also known
                as the Harappan Civilisation — was, at its peak, the most
                extensive of the ancient world's great cultures, surpassing even
                Egypt and Mesopotamia in geographic reach.
            </p>
            <h3>A Civilisation Ahead of Its Time</h3>
            <p>
                What makes the Indus Valley Civilisation so remarkable is the
                sophistication of its urban planning. Cities like Mohenjo-daro
                and Harappa were laid out on precise grid systems, with wide
                main streets and carefully organised residential blocks.

            <p>
                Perhaps most impressively, they possessed advanced drainage and
                sanitation infrastructure — covered sewers, indoor bathrooms,
                and public wells — that would not be seen again in the region
                for thousands of years. These were not rough settlements but
                mature, well-administered cities with populations potentially
                reaching tens of thousands.

                    The script has never been decoded. We may never know their
                    language.
